**Development of the Perbanas Student Affairs Website as Part of an Internship Project with a Team**  

As part of the Internship Program (KKP), my team and I collaborated to design and develop a student affairs website aimed at supporting the information and activity needs of students within the Perbanas campus. This project not only provided hands-on experience in digital technology development but also involved teamwork, problem-solving, and the implementation of effective communication strategies.  

**Project Objective:**  
The website was designed to serve as a platform that facilitates students' access to academic information and campus activities, including class schedules, important announcements, organizational event agendas, and student administrative services.  

**My Roles and Contributions:**  

**1. Website Concept and Structure Design:**  
- Collaborated with the team to create a framework (wireframe) to define page layouts, navigation, and core website features.  
- Ensured that every design element met the studentsâ€™ needs, such as accessibility and ease of use.  

**2. Content Management:**  
- Wrote and organized informative content, such as academic announcements, student organization descriptions, and administrative service guides.  
- Created engaging copywriting for the homepage and other features to make the website both professional and user-friendly.  

**3. Technical Development:**  
- Contributed to coding using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a responsive user interface (UI).  
- Collaborated with team members responsible for backend development to ensure connectivity between the database and features such as the student login system.  

**4. Collaboration and Problem Solving:**  
- Actively participated in team discussions to resolve various technical challenges, such as website speed optimization and device compatibility.  
- Maintained effective communication within the group to ensure that all members understood their roles and responsibilities.  

**5. Testing and Evaluation:**  
- Conducted comprehensive testing of the website to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and security.  
- Gathered feedback from user testing to make improvements and refinements before the website launch.  

**Results:**  
The developed website successfully provided an interactive and user-friendly platform, enabling students to access critical information more quickly and efficiently. This project received appreciation from the campus administration for its contribution to addressing students' digital needs.  

This experience broadened my knowledge of website development while enhancing my communication skills, teamwork abilities, and innovative problem-solving approach.
